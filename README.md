# JavaScript Way

So, we have the web, browsers, HTML, CSS... and the world start spinning. But we needed a cute, little, light, easy and fast language to give life to our new web page. And so, JavaScript was born.

But hey, JavaScript is A LOT more than just that, and for that reason and after having a huge grow in the tech community, JavaScript is everywhere. We have JavaScript on frontend frameworks (if this is a surprise for you then this project isn't for you, start somewhere else and then come back :)! ), backend frameworks, databases, teas, soups, etc, etc.

For this reason companies are starting to need JavaScript Experts, and a lot of Senior Developers whose experience is more pointed to this new JavaScript stack of technologies.

This project aint for beginners, instead is for:

**You Senior Developer who wants to:**
- Clarify some aspects of this language that are making you crazy.
- Stop making the fool out of yourself with every PR you make with this new millennials developers you're working with.

**Companies who wants to:**
- Know how to recruit this new JavaScript Experts or JavaScript Senior Developers, I mean, what should this guys know right?

So, if this project is for you then welcome to

Basic Javascript for Senior JavaScript programmers.

Work In Progress..
